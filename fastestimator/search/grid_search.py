    """A search class that performs the grid search.

    Grid search can be used to find the optimal combination of one or more hyperparameters based on its score function.

    ```python
    search = GridSearch(score_fn=lambda index, a, b: a + b, params={"a": [1, 2, 3], "b": [4, 5, 6]})
    search.fit()
    print(search.get_best_parameters()) # {"a": 3, "b": 6, "index": 9}
    ```

    Args:
        score_fn: Objective function that measures the fitness, index must be one of its argument.
        params: Dictionary with key name matching `score_fn`'s inputs, value to be the list of options.
        best_mode: Whether maximal or minimal fitness is desired, must be either 'min' or 'max'.
        name: The name of the search instance, this is used for saving and loading purpose.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If `params` is not dictionary, or contains key not used by `score_fn`
